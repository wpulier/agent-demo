# Future Upgrade: Adding Vision Capabilities

This document outlines how to upgrade the LoanX.ai application to support image analysis of REPC documents using OpenAI's vision capabilities.

## Why Use Vision API

While the current implementation extracts text from PDFs, using the vision capabilities would allow:
1. Direct analysis of scanned documents without needing text extraction
2. Better handling of documents with complex layouts or images
3. Analysis of handwritten notes or annotations

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Update OpenAI API Call

Replace the current text-based analysis in `app/api/analyze/route.js` with:

```javascript
// Using OpenAI's vision capabilities
const analysisResponse = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4o", // Model with vision capabilities
  input: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: [
        { 
          type: "input_text", 
          text: "Analyze this Real Estate Purchase Contract (REPC) and provide a summary of key information including: buyer and seller names, property address, purchase price, important dates, contingencies, and any special terms. Format the response in a clear, organized way." 
        },
        {
          type: "input_image",
          image_url: {
            // Convert PDF to Base64 URL
            url: `data:application/pdf;base64,${buffer.toString('base64')}`,
            detail: "high"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
});

// Extract the analysis text
const analysisText = analysisResponse.output_text;
```

### 2. Handle Multiple Page Documents

For multi-page documents, you may need to:

1. Split the PDF into individual pages
2. Process each page separately with vision API
3. Combine the results

### 3. Update Dependencies

```bash
npm install pdf-lib # For PDF manipulation if needed
```

### 4. Environment Considerations

- Ensure your OpenAI API key has access to vision models
- Check token usage as vision API may use more tokens than text-based analysis
- Consider caching results to avoid repeated analysis of the same document

## Performance Considerations

- Vision API may be slower than text extraction for large documents
- Consider adding a progress indicator for users
- Implement background processing for very large documents
